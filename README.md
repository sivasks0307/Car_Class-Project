I have added four files to this repository.

  1. cars_class(copy.csv: Complete dataset of the project
  2. Car_class documentation_final.docx: Full documentation about the project from scratch till completion.
  3. GUVI _Final-Project_Car-Class_Logistic_Regression-FINAL.ipynb: Jupyter notebook format code
  4. GUVI _Final-Project_Car-Class_Logistic_Regression-FINAL.py: .py code, provided for convenience in case it needs to be reviewed in an alternative Python IDE.
